-- First, you'd need to truncate the table - this is so our table is emptied between each test run,
-- so we can start with a fresh state.

-- Below this line there should only be `INSERT` statements.
-- Replace these statements with your own seed data.

INSERT INTO students (name, cohort_id) VALUES ('David', '1');
